Hi there, this is my readme.

Essentially this is a coding project that's formed up of a home page, about me, projects and a contact page.

In order to write this code, I used what was learned from class, as well as w3schools as a reference. The Home page is composed of a simple header welcoming the user to the home page, a short paragraph text and a copywright notice at the bottom. At the top of the page is the navigation bar that is coloured using a gradient as requested in the assignment rubric.

The about me page has a title, description, an image of me and a video that you can play.

The projects page has a series of titles explaining each project, date and also a short description explaining them. It containts a linear gradient from the top down. (180deg)

The contact page, has a title, description and a form they can fill out. (it doesn't currently send to anywhere.) It has my email at the bottom with the copyright.

Gradient: Home Page
Angled Linear Gradient: Projects Page

For the color scheme, I stole LinkedIn's colour scheme as I found it simplistic and pretty.
